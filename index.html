        <h2>Early Years</h2>
        <p>
            Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta was born on March 28, 1986, at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, New York City, to an upper-middle-class Catholic family. Her parents have Italian ancestry, and she also has more distant French-Canadian roots. Her parents are Cynthia Louise (née Bissett), a philanthropist and business executive, and Internet entrepreneur Joseph Germanotta, and she has a younger sister named Natali.</p>

        <p>
            Brought up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Gaga said that her parents came from lower-class families and worked hard for everything. She attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart, a private all-girls Roman Catholic school from age eleven. Gaga has described her high-school self as "very dedicated, very studious, very disciplined," and "a bit insecure." She considered herself a misfit and mocked for "being either too provocative or too eccentric."</p>

        <p>
            Gaga began playing the piano at age four when her mother insisted she become "a cultured young woman." She took piano lessons and practiced through her childhood. The classes taught her to create music by ear, which she preferred over reading sheet music.</p>
        
        <p>
            In 2003, at age 17, Gaga gained early admission to Collaborative Arts Project 21, a music school at New York University (NYU)'s Tisch School of the Arts. She studied music and improved her songwriting skills by writing essays on art, religion, social issues, and politics. In 2005, she withdrew from school during the second semester of her second year to focus on her music career. That year, she also played an unsuspecting diner customer for MTV's Boiling Points, a prank reality television show.</p>

            <h3>The Fame Ball Tour</h3>
            <p>
                Gaga headlined the Fame Ball Tour worldwide, which ran from March to September 2009. While traveling the globe, she wrote eight songs for The Fame Monster, a reissue of The Fame. Those new songs were released as a standalone EP on November 18, 2009. Its first single, "Bad Romance," was released one month earlier and went number one in Canada and the UK and number two in the US, Australia, and New Zealand. "Telephone", with Beyoncé, followed as the second single from the EP and became Gaga's fourth UK number one. Both tracks reached the top five in the US. The video for "Bad Romance" became the most-watched on YouTube in April 2010, and that October, Gaga became the first person with more than one billion combined views.</p>

            <h3>Born This Way Tour</h3>
            <p>
                Born This Way was released on May 23, 2011, and debuted atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 1.1 million copies. The album sold eight million copies worldwide and received three Grammy nominations, including Gaga's third consecutive nomination for Album of the Year. Rolling Stone listed it among "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time" in 2020. Born This Way's next singles were "You and I" and "Marry the Night," which reached numbers six and 29 in the US, respectively. While filming the former's music video, Gaga met and started dating actor Taylor Kinney in July 2011, who played her love interest. She also embarked on the Born This Way Ball tour in April 2012, which was scheduled to conclude the following March, but ended one month earlier when Gaga canceled the remaining dates due to a labral tear of her right hip that required surgery. While refunds for the cancellations were estimated to be worth $25 million, the tour grossed $183.9 million globally.</p>

        <h2>Illness</h2>
        <p>
           Lady Gaga postponed her European tour because of an exacerbation of her fibromyalgia. A statement released via Twitter on September 14, 2017, proclaimed that she was “suffering from severe physical pain that has impacted her ability to perform.” Shortly thereafter, Gaga tweeted that she was suffering from fibromyalgia, an illness that I have been studying for 40 years. Around the same time, Netflix released the documentary film Gaga: Five Foot Two and reviews of the film mentioned that Gaga opens up about her “overwhelming pain”.</p>
   
        <p>
            Although Lady Gaga does not state that she has been given a fibromyalgia diagnosis in the film, she tweeted, as noted, in September 2017 (the same month the documentary was released) that she has fibromyalgia. As with many patients, the diagnosis can be elusive. Gaga complains that “I have chased this pain for the past 5 years”. Indeed, the average patient spends about 5 years before a diagnosis is made.</p>
